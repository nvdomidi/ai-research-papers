# AI Research Papers

Summaries and descriptions of papers I'm reading. Mostly Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Robotics.

I got the idea from https://github.com/aleju/papers/tree/master/neural-nets.

- [Improved Techniques for Training GANs](https://github.com/nvdomidi/ai-research-papers/blob/master/Improved-Techniques-for-Training-GANs.md)
